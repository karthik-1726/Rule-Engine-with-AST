APPLICATION NAME: RULE ENGINE with AST
# Simple Rule Engine

## Overview

This is a simple rule engine implemented in Python that uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules. The engine allows for dynamic creation, combination, and evaluation of rules based on user attributes such as age, department, income, and experience.

## Features

- **AST Representation**: Represents rules as an Abstract Syntax Tree for easy manipulation and evaluation.
- **Rule Creation**: Create individual rules using a string format.
- **Rule Combination**: Combine multiple rules into a single logical expression.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluate combined rules against user data to determine eligibility.
- **Basic Comparison Operators**: Supports comparison operators such as >, <, and =.
